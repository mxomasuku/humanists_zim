We strive to build a society that is founded upon freethought, rational thinking, ethics and tolerance. 
We are humanists, which means at the core of our work is the realisation that this is the one life we get and it is our responsibility to make the most out of it, not only for ourselves but for the future of humanity.

<p className='mt-8'>
Humanists Zimbabwe was founded in 2014 although the name Humanists Zimbabwe was first used in 2023 when 2 local secular organisations, Zimbabwean Atheists and PICH (Project for Integrating Cultures in Humanism) joined to become one organisation. Zimbabwean Atheists existed since 2014 as an online community of atheists working towards creating atheistic awareness in Zimbabwe. PICH would only come into existence 5 years later in 2019. The goal of PICH was to provide a platform for secular humanists and non-religious people to create content that spreads awareness of humanism and develop humanist thought from native knowledge systems. 
</p>
<p className='mt-8'>
In 2022, PICH became a member of Humanists International’s global humanist network. The following year, PICH was awarded a grant from Humanists International to create a Secular digital media hub, a necessary move given the stigma and censorship secularist ideas faced in mainstream media. 
</p>

<p className='mt-8'>Today Humanists Zimbabwe exists as a symbol and successor of the collective resilience of the non-religious movement in Zimbabwe aimed at creating a self-sustaining and effective network for a more humane and rational society.</p>

        <div className='text-start'>
     
      <p className='fold-semibold'>Humanists Zimbabwe adopted a common system of objectives used by the Global Humanist Organization Network:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>•	Create awareness</li>
        <li>•	Fight for Acceptance</li>
        <li>•	Campaign for secularism</li>
        <li>•	Promote a life stance</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p className='mt-8'>
      Our work goes beyond activism. We are concerned with the general well-being of our community. We have an open-door podcast development program, meant for building awareness of the humanist life stance and advocacy for living an ethical life.
      </p>
<p className='mt-8'>
With this program, we understand that humanism is still in its infancy in Zimbabwe, so we are collaborating with different youth organisations and community leaders to promote and preserve values which embody our value system as humanists.
