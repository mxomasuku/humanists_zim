const aboutUs = 'We are pro-Human first, not anti-religion. For us, humanism is an ongoing philosophical conversation about being independent, sovereign and how to live right. As such we oppose religion strongly as an institution which undermines the agency of these three in human life. If you are reading this and you arent a humanist we say to you,"Free your mind and live right. Nothing you feel or desire should be held against you. You came into this world as a human not a sheep." Our aim therefore is to bring together all non-religious people in building a freethinking world guided by science and empathy. We believe our society is much better when religion is kept away from discourse about public policy and as such we promote and support any group of people suffering from religious oppression'
