        "question": "What is Humanism?",
    "answer": "Humanism is a non-religious worldview that emphasizes the importance of human reason, ethics, and compassion. It is based on the belief that humans have the ability to create a better world for themselves and others without the need for supernatural intervention. \n\n Humanists believe that we only have one life to live, and that we should make the most of it by living in a way that is ethical and compassionate. They value the importance of education, science, and critical thinking, and they reject all forms of discrimination and bigotry. \n\n Locally, we know Humanism as Hunhu, Humunhu, Ubuntu. The idea of 'hunhu' concerns itself with how you live your life and the ethics of how you act in relation to other people.\n\n Contrary to some modern thinkers, humanism is not a religion that worships humanity. Neither does it claim that humans have the right to selfishly abuse nature for their own ends. \n\n Instead, humanism is simply a way of life pointing to the fact that we are human, we live and we die. But before we die, our greatest resource is our life, and we should all work towards the common goal of making sure that it flourishes and is cultivated to reach its fullest potential."

        "question": "Do you (humanists/atheists) really believe in nothing?",
    "answer": "No! Our lack of belief in God doesn’t mean we don’t believe in anything. \n\n To understand what humanists and atheists believe, you must understand that God is just a story, a fable that people believed and disproportionately took too seriously because they didn’t have the means to contest it. We disregard the story of god(s) and accept a self-evident narrative that as human beings we only have one life to live and in this life, we freely engage in different activities in the pursuit of happiness and meaning. \n\n We believe that we should create a society whose institutions are built towards the enrichment and expansion of the human experience. Our position and modus operandi are backed and improved by science and philosophical investigation which we believe are the best and most rational tools to lead us towards achieving ecological balance."

    "question": "Who, or what is God?",
  "answer": "For humanists and atheists, a God is an unproven claim about the universe. \n\n Some would go so far as to say the idea of a God who is The Creator is nothing but a work of fiction, a lie built to accommodate the fringe ends of our current ignorance. Just as the ancients wrongfully worshipped gods of thunder and lightning because those phenomena confused them, our civilisation worships gods of eternal life and resurrection because death and futility overwhelm us. \n\n There are no literal gods, and religion is a social control mechanism built around the obscurity of what people don’t know and what they fear."

    "question": "If it wasn't god, then who created the universe?",
  "answer": "The question is loaded. It assumes a “who” (some kind of being), instead of a 'what'. While a bunch of ideas exist that are yet to be supported, let’s cut to the chase: We don’t know. \n\n We currently don’t have the means to answer this question, but we can explain the processes that led to the universe’s form as we know it. \n\n Just because we don’t know doesn’t make it credible to assert that a supreme being is responsible. Even so, it doesn’t mean we should worship it unconditionally. When we say that we don’t know, it means we don’t know – nothing more. \n\n We don’t have the means to answer this question ‘yet’ but I imagine in the distant future our advanced descendants will be able to fully explain the universe's origins, even replicate the conditions that led to its rise."
